If anything happens to fail or malfunction, please follow the steps below first to provide some background information when reporting an issue.

Supervisor
----------

DSMR-reader technically consists of these processes (some may or may not be used by you) and they are watched by Supervisor:

+----------------+----------------------------------+
| Webinterface   | ``dsmr_webinterface``            |
+----------------+----------------------------------+
| Datalogger     | ``dsmr_datalogger``              |
+----------------+----------------------------------+
| Backend        | ``dsmr_backend``                 |
+----------------+----------------------------------+
| Export or MQTT | ``dsmr_export`` or ``dsmr_mqtt`` |
+----------------+----------------------------------+

You can view the status of all processes by running::

    sudo supervisorctl status

Any processes listed, should have the status ``RUNNING``. Stale or crashed processes can be restarted with::

    sudo supervisorctl restart <name>
    sudo supervisorctl restart dsmr_backend
    sudo supervisorctl restart ...

Or to restart them all simultaneously::

    sudo supervisorctl restart all

If this does not resolve your issue, check the logfiles for more information:

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Webinterface   | ``/var/log/supervisor/dsmr_webinterface.log``                                    |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Datalogger     | ``/var/log/supervisor/dsmr_datalogger.log``                                      |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Backend        | ``/var/log/supervisor/dsmr_backend.log``                                         |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Export or MQTT | ``/var/log/supervisor/dsmr_export.log`` or ``/var/log/supervisor/dsmr_mqtt.log`` |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Logging
-------
If the processes do run, but you cannot find an error, (e.g.: things seem to hang or tend to be slow), there might be another issue at hand.

DSMR-reader has DEBUG-logging, which makes the system log very verbose about what it's trying to do.
This applies **specifically** to the ``dsmr_backend`` and ``dsmr_export`` (MQTT) processes.

The DEBUG-logging is disabled by default, to reduce writes on the filesystem. You can enable the logging by following these steps:

* Make sure you are ``dsmr`` user by executing ``sudo su - dsmr``.
* Open the ``dsmrreader/settings.py`` file and look for the code below::

    """
        Enable and change the logging level below to alter the verbosity of the (backend) command(s).
        - DEBUG:             Log everything.
        - INFO:              Log most things.
        - WARNING (default): Log only warnings and errors.
    
        Restart the commands in Supervisor to apply any changes.
    """
    # LOGGING['loggers']['commands']['level'] = 'DEBUG'

* Now remove the ``#`` from this line::

    # LOGGING['loggers']['commands']['level'] = 'DEBUG'

* It should now be::

    LOGGING['loggers']['commands']['level'] = 'DEBUG'

* After editing the file, all processes need to be restarted. To do this, you can either execute::

    ./post-deploy.sh

* Or go back to the **sudo user** and execute::

    CTRL+D
    sudo supervisorctl restart all

* All done!


Appplication / Django
---------------------
The application has its own logfiles as well.
You can find them in the ``logs`` directory inside the project folder.

The logfiles are by default located in:

+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``/home/dsmr/dsmr-reader/logs/django.log``     | Lists any internal errors regarding the Django framework it's using |
+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``/home/dsmr/dsmr-reader/logs/dsmrreader.log`` | Contains application logging, if enabled                            |
+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Please note that any errors in there are most likely regarding rejected telegrams and are unlikely causing your issue::

    WARNING @ datalogger | Rejected telegram (Invalid telegram CRC. The calculated checksum '40275' (9D53) does not match the telegram checksum '32756' (7FF4)) ...
